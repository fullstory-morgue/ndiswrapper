ndiswrapper (1.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of ndiswrapper version 1.16, there is a slight difference when using
  wpa_supplicant. The 'wext' driver option must be used instead of
  'ndiswrapper'. For example:

    wpa_supplicant -D wext -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

  When using wpa_supplicant via /etc/network/interfaces, it is suggested to use
  the 'wpa-driver wext' option. More infomation can be found in 
    /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant
  when the wpasupplicant package is installed.
