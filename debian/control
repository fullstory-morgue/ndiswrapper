Description: Common scripts required to use the utilities for ndiswrapper
 Some vendors do not release specifications of the hardware or provide a
 Linux driver for their wireless network cards. This project implements
 Windows kernel API and NDIS (Network Driver Interface Specification) API
 within Linux kernel. A Windows driver for wireless network card is then
 linked to this implementation so that the driver runs natively, as though
 it is in Windows, without binary emulation.
 .
 This package contains wrapper scripts to call out to the proper
 versions of whatever -utils-X.X package is installed.
